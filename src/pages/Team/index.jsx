                Since 1987, Paulsun Development and its family of companies have
                drawn on its founder's extensive background as a Civil Engineer
                to build a strong industry reputation in British Columbia. The
                success of these companies over the past 37 years is attributed
                to expertise, attention to detail, exceptional craftsmanship and
                a hands-on approach. Their impressive portfolio includes land
                assemblies, re-zoning/development and construction of large
                subdivisions, civil infrastructure works, and a vast array of
                commercial and residential projects, such as lowÂ­ rise apartment
                buildings, multi-unit townhouse projects, and finely crafted
                custom homes. Paulsun's mission is to make a lasting impact by
                creating inspired communities to last generations.
